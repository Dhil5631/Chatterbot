I developed Chatterbot, an interactive question-answering application designed to provide accurate responses to user queries. Built with a Python-powered backend and a responsive front-end interface using HTML and CSS, *Chatterbot* offers a streamlined, real-time chat experience. The project incorporates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and interpret user questions effectively, ensuring relevant answers are returned promptly. The front end features a simple, user-friendly chat interface styled through `style.css`, while the back end efficiently processes and delivers responses. This project showcases my skills in full-stack development, combining intuitive design with efficient functionality.
